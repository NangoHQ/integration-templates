                    Sync all the content of google drive from a selected file or
                    folders. PDF files won't be parsed but rather should be fetched
                    via the proxy using the "google-drive-fetch-pdf" action.
                    Details: full sync, supports deletes, goes back all time. Metadata
                    required to filter on a particular folder, or file(s). Metadata
                    fields should be {"files": ["<some-id>"]} OR
                    {"folders": ["<some-id>"]}. The ID should be able to be provided
                    by using the Google Picker API
                    (https://developers.google.com/drive/picker/guides/overview)
